[Big Data With Spark &amp; Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/taming-big-data-with-apache-spark-hands-on) 

The devlopment environment is Spark setup on top of a JDK in a Python environment with [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Hadoop is mocked with the [winutils package](https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils).

Datasets used:
* Local machine processing ml-100k found [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/).

[Windows setup instructions](https://sundog-education.com/spark-python/); follow explicitly because Windows requires workarounds to run Spark of course. ðŸ˜¢
